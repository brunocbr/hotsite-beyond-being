## The conference

We are delighted to announce a 4-day international conference on the theme of transcendence in ancient philosophy. The conference will take place at both the Federal University of ABC and the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo.

With the claim that the Form of the Good is beyond being (*epekeina tês ousias*, *Republic*, 509b8), Plato has (maybe not willingly) inaugurated a philosophical tradition which investigates transcendent hyper-ontological realities and their relationship with being. The necessity to accept the existence of ineffable entities as the ultimate principles of reality can be found at the center of many Neoplatonic philosophies and has caused intense discussions. In this conference, we aim to pursue this discussion and welcome any paper on the theme of transcendence, its origin, its development and its critics in ancient philosophy.

Confirmed Speakers (in alphabetical order):

-   Angela Ulacco (University of Leuven)
-   Gábor Betegh (University of Cambridge)
-   Gabriele Cornelli (University of Brasília)
-   Lucas Angioni (Unicamp)
-   Matthew Duncombe (University of Nottingham)
